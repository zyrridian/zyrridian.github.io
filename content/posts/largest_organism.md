<!-- # The Largest Living Organism on Earth -->

The largest living organism isn’t a whale or a tree—it’s a fungus! The "honey fungus" (Armillaria ostoyae) in Oregon spans over 3.5 miles and is estimated to be thousands of years old.

This organism grows underground, with a network of mycelium that spreads across the forest floor. Despite its massive size, most of it remains hidden beneath the surface.

**Mind-Blowing Fact:** The fungus weighs an estimated 35,000 tons—making it heavier than 200 blue whales!
