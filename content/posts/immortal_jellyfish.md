<!-- # The Immortal Jellyfish -->

Turritopsis dohrnii, known as the "immortal jellyfish," has a unique ability: it can reverse its aging process! When under stress or injury, it reverts to its polyp stage, effectively starting its life cycle anew.

This process, called transdifferentiation, makes it biologically immortal. However, these jellyfish can still fall prey to predators or disease.

**Did You Know?** The jellyfish is smaller than a human pinky nail but holds secrets to anti-aging research.
