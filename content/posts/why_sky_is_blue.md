The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earthâ€™s atmosphere, it interacts with air molecules and scatters. Shorter blue wavelengths scatter more than longer red ones, filling the sky with blue light.

At sunrise and sunset, the sky looks red because the light travels through more atmosphere, scattering away the shorter blue wavelengths and leaving the reds and oranges.

**Science Tidbit:** On Mars, the sky appears red during the day but blue at sunset!
