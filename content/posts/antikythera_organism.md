<!-- # The Mystery of Antikythera Mechanism -->

Discovered in a shipwreck in 1901, the Antikythera Mechanism is an ancient Greek device that has baffled scientists for over a century. Itâ€™s considered the first analog computer, designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses.

The mechanism contains over 30 intricate gears and was used as far back as 100 BCE. Modern reconstructions reveal its complexity rivals that of 18th-century clockwork.

**Historical Wonder:** No similar technology reappeared for over a thousand years!
