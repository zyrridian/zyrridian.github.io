<!-- # Exploring Quantum Entanglement -->

Quantum entanglement is a fascinating phenomenon where particles become interconnected, such that the state of one instantly influences the other, no matter how far apart they are. Albert Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

This concept is not just theoreticalâ€”scientists are leveraging it to develop quantum computers and secure communication methods. In 2022, researchers successfully teleported quantum information over 60 kilometers of optical fiber, marking a significant milestone.

**Did you know?** Entangled particles are so intertwined that measuring one instantly reveals the other's properties!
